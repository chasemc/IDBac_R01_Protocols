<H1 align="center"> Sample Preparation </H1>


If you haven't already, download the Excel template for renaming raw data files [here.](/MALDI-Plate_Template/384_Spot_MALDI_Template.xltx) This template was designed to work with MALDI plates of up to 384 spots.

___

- Using the Excel®/OpenOffice™ template mentioned above, simply enter your sample names into the spreadsheet as seen below.

</p>


If you don’t have access to Microsoft Excel, we have successfully tested this with the free Excel alternative:  Apache OpenOffice™ “Calc”, which can be found at [www.openoffice.org](www.openoffice.org). When saving the file, ensure you save it as type “Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP (.xls)”.



- The excel file will be named as the date the plate was created and the last five-digits of the MALDI-target-plate serial number:
    - *dd_mm_yyyy_sssss* 
    - Use format above, which stands for: (day_month_year_LastFiveOfSerialNumber)

### Cleaning MALDI Target Plates

The MALDI plate should be properly cleaned before use.  In order to clean the MALDI plate, use the steps below:
(method adapted from [Freiwald & Sauer](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v4/n5/full/nprot.2009.37.html?foxtrotcallback=true))

1. Remove target plate from holder and rinse with HPLC grade methanol.
2. Air-dry, prevent touching or contaminating the top surface of the plate (the side with writing and MALDI-spot circles)

___

### MALDI Matrix Preparation
1. Prepare 10 mg/mL MALDI-grade [alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search?term=28166-41-8&interface=CAS%20No.&N=0&mode=partialmax&lang=en&region=US&focus=product) (CHCA) in MS-grade solvents:
   - 50% Acetonitrile (ACN)
   - 47.5% Water (H<sub>2</sub>O)
   - 2.5% Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA)
     - e.g. 400 µL of solution = 200 µL ACN + 190 µL H<sub>2</sub>O + 10 µL TFA + 4 mg CHCA
     
- You will be using 1 µL per MALDI spot.
- Use matrix solution within 1 week and store unused solid and prepared CHCA matrix between 2-8 °C, in the dark.

| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1. Apply bacteria directly without any prior chemical treatment. Smear a single bacterial colony in a thin layer directly onto the MALDI target plate using a sterile toothpick. | <img src= "ReadMe_Images/ApplyingToMALDIPlate1.png" width= 100% /> |
| 2. Leave the PepMix and BTS spots empty.   |               |
| 3. Add 1 µL of 70% formic acid to each bacterial spot, let air dry. | <img src= "ReadMe_Images/ApplyingToMALDIPlate2.png" width= 100% />            |
| 4. Add 1 µL of MALDI matrix to each bacterial spot, let air dry.    | <img src= "ReadMe_Images/ApplyingToMALDIPlate3.png" width= 100% />          |

##### Cleaning MALDI Target Plates

The MALDI plate should be properly cleaned before shipping.  In order to clean the MALDI plate, use the steps below:
method adapted from [Freiwald & Sauer](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v4/n5/full/nprot.2009.37.html?foxtrotcallback=true)

1. Remove target plate from holder and rinse with acetone.
2. To remove trace protein/lipids, use non-abrasive liquid soap.
3. Rinse with distilled water ~2 min to completely remove soap.
4. Sonicate in HPLC grade water (Ultrasonic bath) for ~5 min.
5. Rinse with HPLC grade water.
6. Rinse with HPLC grade methanol.

<H3 align="center">  Data Storage </H3>
<br>


- All raw data will be named/stored in the following format:
  - Per MALDI plate
    - Each run will be saved within a folder named with the same name as the corresponding excel file, in the format dd_mm_yyyy_sssss
    - The protein run will be saved within this dd_mm_yyyy_sssss folder, in a directory called "p"
    - The small molecule run will be saved within this dd_mm_yyyy_sssss folder, in a directory called "s"
    - ![](ReadMe_Images/Raw_data_folder_structure.PNG)  (Picture has dashes instead of underscores)
  
    
- The correspdonding excel file will be placed inside the dd_mm_yyyy_sssss folder
- Each dd_mm_yyyy_sssss folder will then be saved for long-term storage by compressing to ".7z" with 7-zip. https://www.7-zip.org/
  - This will immediately be stored:
    - Locally on a RAID device. Location:
    - In the cloud. Location:
