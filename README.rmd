# Materials

Note:  We use Sigma	Product: C2020  as our MALDI matrix, however we also recrystallize before use to purify it further. Sigma also sells a higher-grade MALDI matrix.

## Documenting sample positions on MALDI plates
If you haven't already, download the Excel template [here.](https://drive.google.com/a/uic.edu/file/d/1QrHYVfDiLrmXUmdmfasUikIfbzD_eOx9/view?usp=sharing) 

- Using the Excel template mentioned above, simply enter your sample names into the blue-boxes at the top of the spreadsheet. Excel will then assign these to spots on the depicted MALDI plate.
- Also, in the appropriate cells of the excel sheet, enter the product and lot/batch number of MALDI matrix used. 


If you don’t have access to Microsoft Excel, you can use any other spreadsheet software such as:  Apache OpenOffice™ "Calc", which can be found at [www.openoffice.org](www.openoffice.org). When saving the file, ensure you save it as type "Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP (.xls or .xlsx)".


## Naming the excel file
- The excel file will be saved as the date the plate was started and the last five-digits of the MALDI target plate serial number:
    - *dd_mm_yyyy_sssss* 
    - (day_month_year_LastFiveOfSerialNumber)




## Cleaning the MALDI plate
Before applying bacteria:  

  1. Remove target plate from holder and briefly rinse with HPLC grade methanol.
  2. Air-dry, prevent touching or contaminating the top surface of the plate (the side with writing and MALDI-spot circles)


## MALDI Matrix Preparation
1. Prepare 10 mg/mL MALDI-grade [alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search?term=28166-41-8&interface=CAS%20No.&N=0&mode=partialmax&lang=en&region=US&focus=product) (CHCA) in MS-grade solvents:
   - 50% Acetonitrile (ACN)
   - 47.5% Water (H<sub>2</sub>O)
   - 2.5% Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA)
     - e.g. 400 µL of solution = 200 µL ACN + 190 µL H<sub>2</sub>O + 10 µL TFA + 4 mg CHCA

- Sonicate or vortex the solution until no matrix crystals are observed. The matrix is then ready to be applied.


- You will be require 1 µL per MALDI spot.
- Use matrix solution within 1 week and store unused solid and prepared CHCA matrix between 2-8 °C, in the dark.

| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1. Apply bacteria directly without any prior chemical treatment. Smear a single bacterial colony in a thin layer directly onto the MALDI target plate using a sterile toothpick. | <img src= "ReadMe_Images/ApplyingToMALDIPlate1.png" width= 100% /> |
| 2. Leave the Calibration spots empty.   |               |
| 3. Add 1 µL of 70% formic acid to each spot containing bacteria. Let air dry. | <img src= "ReadMe_Images/ApplyingToMALDIPlate2.png" width= 100% />            |

## Cleaning the MALDI plate
The MALDI plate should be properly cleaned before shipping. In order to clean the MALDI plate, use the steps below:
method adapted from [Freiwald & Sauer](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v4/n5/full/nprot.2009.37.html?foxtrotcallback=true)

  1. Remove target plate from holder and rinse with acetone.
  2. To remove trace protein/lipids, use non-abrasive liquid soap.
  3. Rinse with distilled water ~2 min to completely remove soap.
  4. Sonicate in HPLC grade water (Ultrasonic bath) for ~5 min.
  5. Rinse with HPLC grade water.
  6. Rinse with HPLC grade methanol.


## Acquiring Data

Each plate will require multiple calibration spots. For protein data, follow the directions in the pdf link below:
  - Bruker Biotyper calibration procedure: 
    - https://www.bruker.com/fileadmin/user_upload/8-PDF-Docs/Separations_MassSpectrometry/InstructionForUse/IFU_Bruker_Bacterial_Test_Standard_Revision_C.pdf
