# Materials

Note:  We use Sigma	Product: C2020  as our MALDI matrix, however we also recrystallize before use to purify it further. Sigma also sells a higher-grade MALDI matrix.

## Cultivating Bacteria

Prepare the following solution and scale ingredients to the volume needed. Autoclave to sterilize.

  - Soluble starch: 5 g
  - Yeast extract: 2 g
  - Peptone: 1 g
  - Agar: 7.5 g
  - Deionized water: 500 mL


If using 60 mm or larger petri-dishes, make a dilution-streak of a single strain on a single dish to to allow the formation of individual colonies.
If using multi-well plates, plate each strain into 8 different wells. 

Allow the bacteria to grow for a period of 7 days. (e.g. Inoculate agar plate on Monday -> put onto MALDI plate the following Monday).

  - Because it is still unclear whether time has an effect on MALDI spectra of different types of bacteria, it is important to plate bacteria at similar timepoints.

## Documenting sample positions on MALDI plates
If you haven't already, download the Excel template [here.](https://drive.google.com/a/uic.edu/file/d/1QrHYVfDiLrmXUmdmfasUikIfbzD_eOx9/view?usp=sharing) 

- Using the Excel template mentioned above, simply enter your sample names into the blue-boxes at the top of the spreadsheet. Excel will then assign these to spots on the depicted MALDI plate.
- Also, in the appropriate cells of the excel sheet, enter the product number and lot/batch number of MALDI matrix used. 


If you don’t have access to Microsoft Excel, you can use any other spreadsheet software such as:  Apache OpenOffice™ "Calc", which can be found at [www.openoffice.org](www.openoffice.org). When saving the file, ensure you save it as type "Microsoft Excel 97/2000/XP (.xls or .xlsx)".


## Naming the excel file
- The excel file will be saved as the date the plate was started and the last five-digits of the MALDI target plate serial number:
    - Filename: *yyyy_mm_dd_sssss* 
    - (year_month_day_LastFiveOfSerialNumber)

___


## Cleaning the MALDI plate
Before applying bacteria:  

  1. Remove target plate from holder and briefly rinse with HPLC grade methanol.
  2. Air-dry (~5-10 min until dry), prevent touching or contaminating the top surface of the plate (the side with writing and MALDI-spot circles)


## MALDI Matrix Preparation
1. Prepare 10 mg/mL MALDI-grade [alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search?term=28166-41-8&interface=CAS%20No.&N=0&mode=partialmax&lang=en&region=US&focus=product) (CHCA) in MS-grade solvents:
   - 50% Acetonitrile (ACN)
   - 47.5% Water (H<sub>2</sub>O)
   - 2.5% Trifluoroacetic Acid (TFA)
     - e.g. 400 µL of solution = 200 µL ACN + 190 µL H<sub>2</sub>O + 10 µL TFA + 4 mg CHCA

- Sonicate or vortex the solution until no matrix crystals are observed. The matrix is then ready to be applied.


- You will need to make enough matrix solution to have at least 1 µL for each MALDI spot. (I recommend making a little more than needed, to account for slight evaporation of matrix while working)
- Use matrix solution within 1 week and store unused solid and prepared CHCA matrix between 2-8 °C, in the dark.

## Applying Samples to the MALDI Plate

knitr::include_graphics("ReadMe_Images/jove.png")
```
</center>


<br>


### Note on Replicates:
Each strain will have 8 biological replicates (8 MALDI spots). Each replicate is the result of touching a toothpick to a different colony/different part of a colony.

If using 60 mm or larger petri-dishes, create only one petri-dish per strain.

  - For each of the eight MALDI spots, cell-material will be taken from a different colony/part of a colony on the petri-dish (or if the petri-dish is completely covered, from eight locations randomly-distributed across the plate). Do not pick colonies of only one morphology/phenotype (e.g. if multiple phenotypes exist such as orange versus orange with black spores, make sure to sample both types within the 8 replicates; if very different phenotypes exist, reassess purity before MALDI analysis).
  
If using multi-well agar plates, create eight different wells per strain.

  - Each of the 8 MALDI spots corresponds to a different well in the multi-well agar plate.

# Murphy Lab

## Cleaning the MALDI plate
The MALDI plate should be properly cleaned before shipping. In order to clean the MALDI plate, use the steps below:
method adapted from [Freiwald & Sauer](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v4/n5/full/nprot.2009.37.html?foxtrotcallback=true)

  1. Remove target plate from holder and rinse with acetone.
  2. To remove trace protein/lipids, use non-abrasive liquid soap.
  3. Rinse with distilled water ~2 min to completely remove soap.
  4. Sonicate in HPLC grade water (Ultrasonic bath) for ~5 min.
  5. Rinse with HPLC grade water.
  6. Rinse with HPLC grade methanol.


## Acquiring Data

Each plate will require multiple calibration spots. For protein data, follow the directions in the pdf link below:
